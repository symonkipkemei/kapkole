<INTRODUCTION>

<h1 id="intro">File Search</h1>

## brief
- Do it for your country, do it for your name. Be a champion!


## Task:
    ```
    For this project, you should use OOP techniques to create a text-based command-line interface role-playing game or update your existing CLI game.

    Task Instructions
    Build a text-based role-playing game that has at least two classes:

    Hero(): the protagonist of your game that the player controls and identifies with. There should be only one hero.
    Opponent(): the challengers that the player meets throughout the gameplay. There should be multiple opponents.
    The hero should encounter multiple opponents of different strengths or levels. They should be able to perform different actions when meeting an opponent. These actions should be at a minimum:

    attack
    or run away
    If the Hero chooses to attack, the program decides through a simulated dice throw that takes the current level into account, whether the hero or the opponent wins this round:

    Also implement consequences for winning and losing, e.g. forcing the hero to wait a few seconds before continuing the game in case they lose. Or removing the opponent from the opponent pool in case the hero wins.

    You'll have to implement both attributes and methods for both of your classes. Think about what you'll need so you can model the described functionality. Map out the project before you start coding.
